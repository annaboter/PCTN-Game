# PCTN Presentation Game
Choose your own adventure game for the course Postcolonial Transitions and Transnational Justice 

Motivation: 
Why this game? 

A different experience than: 
Very popular games such as Kolonisten van Catan, Risk, Stratego —> The only way you can “win” is by conquering 

This is a game, but from the perspective of the “colonized”, a different kind of game because one starts from, and is led by one's “personal” experience. This experience is inevitably marked by the coloniality of gender. 

The game enforces you to acknowledge that through colonialism: 
- You (the colonized) have to deal with whatever (limited) choices you are given 
- You are dependent of others/forced to go along with the decision of others in order to create a “majority/opposition” 

We recognize that this game was not unproblematic because: 
- We have chosen to go along with a very Western, Eurocentered story about Pocahontas (simultaneously, it did not feel right to make up our own “story”  because obviously in writing our story, we would try to “do good” and try to avoid biases but we believe that this is inevitable. By going with a story that is very popular in common discourse, we believed we would be able to criticize the story of Pocahontas with you). 
- By going with the story of Pocahontas, we were mainly dependent on Eurocentered, Western sources/discourse/depictions/images. 
- By creating and playing this game, we obviously simplify very complex experiences/situations 
- Through this game, Pocahontas does not really get any agency herself. 

However, we wanted to create a (hopefully) unique experience/game in which we simultaneously adhere to and challenge Eurocentered, Western discourse about colonialism and the coloniality of gender.
